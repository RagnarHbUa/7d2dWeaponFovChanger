# 7d2dWeaponFovChanger
C# mod for 7 days to die game (https://7daystodie.com/).
Credits for initial version go to ivailogeimara with his work https://community.7daystodie.com/topic/21699-weaponhands-fov-camera-distance-changer/ .

Mine version is merely an adaptation for Alpha 20 and removal of other C# mods dependencies.
Inside Mod folder you may find "Config.xml" with line 
<weapon_fov value="120" />
By which you can change fov. Unfortunatelly, one needs to completely restart game to apply new value.

# Installation
